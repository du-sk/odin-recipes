<h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1 teaspoon salt per pound of beef, 1 teaspoon black pepper, and granulated garlic in a small bowl and mix well. 
                <br>
                Set the beef on a piece of butcher paper, and apply half of salt mixture evenly to each side, tamping it on lightly with a fork. Press the sides of the roast onto any seasoning that has fallen onto the paper. Place beef on a wire rack set over a pan. Refrigerate the “dry brined” beef, uncovered, for 24 hours, turning meat over once after 12 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe pan or skillet over high heat; add beef to pan and sear on both sides until nicely browned (~3 minutes per side).Sear on the sides if desired</li>
            <li>Turn off heat, add onions to the pan and top with mushrooms. Season vegetables with the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Drizzle melted butter over vegetables, and brush melted butter over beef. </li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (170 degrees C), and continue to roast beef until desired internal temperature is reached. Begin to check temperature after 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef to a plate, and cover loosely with foil. Let it rest at least 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Remove mushrooms from pan and keep warm until ready to serve</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon cold butter in the pan over medium-high heat; sprinkle in flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in vinegar and beef broth, and bring mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste, and add thyme leaves.</li>
            <li>Continue boiling on medium-high heat until gravy reduces by about half and thickens slightly. Gravy can be reduced more for a thicker texture. </li>
            <li>Once meat is rested, slice thinly at a 45-degree angle, and serve with mushrooms and hot gravy over the top.</li>
        </ol>
