        </ul>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high.</li>
        <li>Upon sizzling, break up the beef into small pieces with a potato masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up depending on the desired texture. Continue to cook and break up beef until it is no longer pink (~7 min).</li>

        <li>Stir, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pot as you do. Let mixture boil until liquid is reduced by about half (2-3 min).</li>
        <li>Add sugar, oregano, garlic powder, diced tomatoes and jarred salsa. Stir in; return mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Stir in beans, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until chili is thickened and flavor is developed to your liking, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Taste, adjust the seasoning. Top with sour cream, green onions, Cheddar cheese, and cilantro as desired.</li>
    </ol>
